Researchers found our back door.

I found a vulnerability in your proprietary mobility stack 
enabling unauthorized remote control over Bluetooth.

Cue-13
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.500
Your AVs are unsafe. 

Cue-14
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.700
My crew engineered a free software patch
that disables Bluetooth access to the onboard software.

Cue-15
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Who are you?

Cue-16
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.500

Dude, you’re never going to believe
what’s going on!

Cue-28
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.500
What?!

Cue-29
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.000
I laid my bike down. 
I got run off the road by another biker. 

Cue-30
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.500
I’m in an ambulance. 
One of those new autonomous models. 

Cue-31
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.000
We were on the way to the hospital, 
but someone has taken control of the vehicle remotely.

Cue-32
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.000
I’ve got your location. Whoever’s doing
this has to be close.

Cue-33
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.000
The same biker that ran me off the road
is right behind us!

Cue-34
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.000

I transmitted a patch disabling remote
control. Follow me.

Cue-42
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.500
The police arrested the mysterious rider. 
It turns out she was hired by DeceptiCor. 

Cue-43
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000
They knew about the bug! 

Cue-44
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.000
It was a backdoor designed to open 
up a lucrative aftermarket in the private security industry. 

Cue-45
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.800
DeceptiCor was putting millions of users are at risk!

Cue-46
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Everyone should have the right to run, study, 
fix and share software they use. 

Cue-47
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.500
Especially when it’s a matter of public safety!

<i>(Motorcycle speeding over background music)</i>

Cue-49
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:59.500
Proprietary software poses unacceptable risks in a world 
of increased dependence on automated systems.
